    * **No special characters** allowed (e.g., `@`, `#`, `.`, `!`).
    * Cannot be **null**, **empty**, or made only of whitespace.
    * Invalid name throws an `InvalidTeamNameException`
* **Score values**:

    * Must be integers in the inclusive range **0 to 1000**.
    * Negative or too high values throw an `InvalidScoreException`.
* **Summary sorting**:

    * Matches are **sorted immediately** after adding each to the summary list.
    * Sorting rules:

        1. By total score (descending),
        2. By match creation time (most recent first, if tied).
